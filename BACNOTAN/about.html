<p class="para">The town of Bacnotan was formally founded in 1599 as part of Ilocos Sur. 
In 1785, during the administration of the Governor-General Jose Basco, Bacnotan became a part of Pangasinan. 
When La Union was created in 1850, Bacnotan was one of the 12 towns that formed the province.
In the past, Bacnotan was only a vast expanse of wilderness inhabited by natives with a rudimentary form of government. 
The word "basnutan" means "flog" in the local dialect, and become a byword among the inhabitants, hence the name of the town. 
During the Spanish period, the name of the town was changed from "basnutan" to "Bacnotan" as shown by documents which are still kept intact at the National Archives in Manila.
The town's history is linked with the deeds of heroic men who fought, bled, and died for their own native land.
 At the turn of the century, during the Spanishâ€“American War, Dumarang (now known as Quirino), was a scene of carnage and plunder.
